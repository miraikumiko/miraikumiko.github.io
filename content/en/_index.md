# Introduction

Hello, hello! My name is Ada, let's get acquainted \o/

I am a Python web developer, Linux engineer and system administrator. I host my own [social network](https://underground.pm) which based on [Misskey](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey). I love to travel, make new acquaintances with interesting people, play chess. I provide a service for creating static sites for a nominal fee, here are [examples](https://github.com/miraikumiko) of my work.

Here I blog and write articles in which I share my own experience. In addition, I have a [microblog](https://cr8r.gg/@miraikumiko) in which I write about everything.
