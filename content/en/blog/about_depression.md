I don't see the point in self-flagellation. Usually, when people whine online about how bad everything is for them and how they don't want to live, a reasonable question arises: what have they done to make things good?

Felt sorry for the unfortunate and want to support them? — Go to hell! Here it was only important to attract your attention, to feed the pride, even at the cost of someone else's mood. In my opinion, this is mean and happens because of immaturity.

That's why I invented a device that can give any person the will to live! To begin with, a person needs to be fixed on a chair, a mechanism with a half-loaded revolver is installed behind him. The mechanism asks the person if he wants to live, and he must answer within three seconds: «yes» or «no». In the case of a negative answer or the time has expired, the mechanism pulls the trigger and if there is no shot, a cartridge is added to the revolver, and the drum is twisted. The cycle is repeated until the first shot or a positive answer.

It may seem that my invention is unsafe, but I hasten to assure you that it is safer than the most harmless attraction from a children's amusement park! Warm yellow liquid will start flowing from the chair before the first question is asked :)
