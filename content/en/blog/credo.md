My main guidelines of life are individualism, rationalism, minimalism, and utilitarianism. Perhaps somebody won't like what all these words sound like anon(ism), but in general, life comes down to not getting displeasure and getting pleasure. After all, we're just primates with abstract thinking. So, for a more comfortable existence, we need to evaluate the current reality and make decisions based on common sense, and because of this utilitarianism: "The greatest happiness for the greatest number". Minimalism makes things clear and ordered; this brings clarity, so it's part of my principles. I think these ideologies are right, and I believe they can make me closer to truth because they are based on rationalism. It's made my individuality independent of the opinions of others, because I have mine, protected from cataclysms of any kind. That's why my opinion is always balanced from all sides and objective. My guide is the truth, not the first ideology I like. It may seem that this is an extremely conservative view of the world, but I assure you that such thinking requires extremely flexible and dynamic mind. There are just some obvious things that don't make sense to waste time thinking about, for example: the ass has two halves. This means that when someone is for the left or for the right, he cannot claim objectivity and integrity post factum. Events are cyclical, what happens in the world has always happened since the very beginning of civilization, which has existed for more than 5,000 years. Literally at least every century, generations of sons step on the same rake that their fathers stepped on, and so on down the chain... If you haven't found a match within a century, you haven't been looking carefully enough!

For simple people, children are ungrateful offspring; for philosophers, ideas which mate in the heads of the greatest people, forcing them to change this world. My personality will live, even when my body dies, because the consciousness is chaotically intertwined information received from outside. The world can be interpreted as a bottomless ocean, from which water is scooped into a vessel in the shape of a man. When a vessel breaks, its contents don't disappear and return to where they were taken from.
