It's time to introduce myself, my name is Ada.

Exactly one year ago I started working on anonymous VDS hosting. I was amazed that there was no hosting that would meet the basic criteria of [freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) and privacy. Seeing this as a problem, I decided to create my own hosting accessible from all hidden networks, working without JS and with the Monero cryptocurrency payment system. I bought an old server specifically for virtualization Dell PowerEdge C6220, bought a mountain of RAM and a couple of disks for it. In total, I had 128 virtual cores, 270 GB of RAM and 9 TB of disk space at my disposal.

The backend was developed in Python, often having to rewrite the project from scratch due to lack of experience and understanding of what the end result should be, but in less than a year the software was ready. Still, it couldn't do without one JS [library](https://novnc.com/info.html), but without it manual installation of operating systems would have been impossible.

Unfortunately, the startup turned out to be too expensive and the business itself was unprofitable, so I had to put it off until later.

Now I offer my services in creating websites to small businesses, so you know who to [contact](/contacts)^^
